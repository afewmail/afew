Command Line Usage
==================

Ultimately afew is a command line tool.  You have to specify an action, and
whether to act on all messages, or only on new messages.  The actions you can
choose from are:

tag
  run the tag filters.  See `Initial tagging`_.

watch
  continuously monitor the mailbox for new files

move-mails
  move mail files between maildir folders

Initial tagging
---------------

Basic tagging stuff requires no configuration, just run

.. code-block:: sh

    $ afew --tag --new
    # or to tag *all* messages
    $ afew --tag --all

To do this automatically you can add the following hook into your
`~/.offlineimaprc`:

.. code-block:: ini

    postsynchook = ionice -c 3 chrt --idle 0 /bin/sh -c "notmuch new && afew --tag --new"

There is a lot more to say about general filter :doc:`configuration`
and the different :doc:`filters` provided by afew.

Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^

Adding `--dry-run` to any `--tag` or `--sync-tags` action prevents
modification of the notmuch db. Add some `-vv` goodness to see some
action.

Move Mode
---------

To invoke afew in move mode, provide the `--move-mails` option on the
command line.  Move mode will respect `--dry-run`, so throw in
`--verbose` and watch what effects a real run would have.

In move mode, afew will check all mails (or only recent ones) in the
configured maildir folders, deciding whether they should be moved to
another folder.

The decision is based on rules defined in your config file. A rule is
bound to a source folder and specifies a target folder into which a
mail will be moved that is matched by an associated query.

This way you will be able to transfer your sorting principles roughly
to the classic folder based maildir structure understood by your
traditional mail server. Tag your mails with notmuch, call afew
`--move-mails` in an offlineimap presynchook and enjoy a clean inbox
in your webinterface/GUI-client at work.

For information on how to configure rules for move mode, what you can
do with it and what you can't, please refer to :doc:`move_mode`.

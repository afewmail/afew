This file contains more detailed information on how to configure afew's tag
filters than has been presented in the README.


Customizing filters
===================

Customization of tag filters takes place in afew's config file in
~/.config/afew/config.

To customize your filters, there are basically two different possibilities:

Let's say you like the SpamFilter, but it is way too polite

 1. Create an filter object and customize it

    ~~~snip~~~
    [SpamFilter.0] # note the index
    message = meh
    ~~~snip~~~

    The index is required iff you want to create a new SpamFilter *in addition
    to* the default one. If you need just one customized SpamFilter, you can
    drop the index and customize the default instance.

 2. Create a new type...

    ~~~snip~~~    
    [ShitFilter(SpamFilter)]
    message = I hatez teh spam!
    ~~~snip~~~

    and create an object or two

    ~~~snip~~~
    [ShitFilter.0]
    [ShitFilter.1]
    message = Me hatez it too.
    ~~~snip~~~


Configuration options
=====================

This sections explains how the different filters may be tweaked.


SpamFilter
----------
spam_tag = <tag>

 * Add <tag> to all mails recognized as spam.
 * The default is 'spam'.
 * You may use it to tag your spam as 'junk', 'scum' or whatever suits your mood.
   Note that only a single tag is supported here.


ArchiveSentMailFilter
---------------------
sent_tag = <tag>

 * Add <tag> to all mails sent from one of your configured mail addresses.
 * The default is to add no tag.
 * You may e.g. use it to tag all mails sent by you as 'sent'. This may make
   special sense in conjunction with a mail client that is able to not only search
   for threads but individual mails as well.


FolderNameFilter
----------------
folder_blacklist = <folder list>

 * Never tag mails with tag in <folder list>. <folder list> is a space separated
   list, not enclosed in quotes or any other way.
 * The default is to blacklist no folders.
 * You may use it e.g. to avoid mails being tagged as 'INBOX' when there is the more
   standard 'inbox' tag.

folder_transforms = <transformation rules>

 * Transform folder names according to the specified rules before tagging mails.
   <transformation rules> is a space separated list consisting of
   'folder:tag' style pairs. The colon separates the name of the folder to be
   transformed from the tag it is to be transformed into.
 * The default is to transform to folder names.
 * You may use the rules e.g. to transform the name of your 'Junk' folder into your
   'spam' tag or fix capitalization of your draft and sent folder: 
    ~~~snip~~~
    folder transforms = Junk:spam Drafts:draft Sent:sent
    ~~~snip~~~

maildir_separator = <sep>

 * Use <sep> to split your maildir hierarchy into individual tags.
 * The default is to split on '.'
 * If your maildir hierarchy is represented in the filesystem as collapsed dirs,
   <sep> is used to split it again before applying tags. If your maildir looks
   like this:
   ~~~snip~~~
   [...]
   /path/to/maildir/devel.afew/[cur|new|tmp]/...
   /path/to/maildir/devel.alot/[cur|new|tmp]/...
   /path/to/maildir/devel.notmuch/[cur|new|tmp]/...
   [...]
   ~~~snip~~~
   the mails in your afew folder will be tagged with 'devel' and 'afew'.
   
   If instead your hierarchy is split by a more conventional '/' or any other
   divider
   ~~~snip~~~
   [...]
   /path/to/maildir/devel/afew/[cur|new|tmp]/...
   /path/to/maildir/devel/alot/[cur|new|tmp]/...
   /path/to/maildir/devel/notmuch/[cur|new|tmp]/...
   [...]
   ~~~snip~~~
   you need to configure that divider to have your mails properly tagged:
   ~~~snip~~~
   maildir_separator = /
   ~~~snip~~~

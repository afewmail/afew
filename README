About
=====

afew is an initial tagging script for notmuch mail:
 * http://notmuchmail.org/
 * http://notmuchmail.org/initial_tagging/

Its basic task is to provide automatic tagging each time new mail is registered
with notmuch. In a classic setup, you might call it after 'notmuch new' in an
offlineimap post sync hook.

In addition to more elementary features such as adding tags based on email
headers or maildir folders, handling killed threads and spam, it can do some
heavy magic in order to /learn/ how to initially tag your mails based on their
content.

fyi: afew plays nicely with alot, a GUI for notmuch mail ;)

Features
========

* text classification, magic tags aka the mailing list without server
* spam handling (flush all tags, add spam)
* killed thread handling
* tags posts to lists with lists, $list-id
* autoarchives mails sent from you
* catchall -> remove new, add inbox
* can operate on new messages [default], --all messages or on custom
  query results
* has a --dry-run mode for safe testing


Installation
============

You'll need dbacl for the text classification:

# aptitude install dbacl

And I'd like to suggest to install afew as your unprivileged user.
If you do, make sure ~/.local/bin is in your path.

$ python setup.py install --prefix=~/.local
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/afew/categories


Configuration
=============

Make sure that ~/.notmuch-config reads:

~~~ snip ~~~
[new]
tags=new
~~~ snip ~~~


Commandline help
================

$ afew --help
Usage: afew [options] [--] [query]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  Actions:
    Please specify exactly one action (both update actions can be
    specified simultaniously).

    -t, --tag           run the tag filter
    -l LEARN, --learn=LEARN
                        train the category with the messages matching the
                        given query
    -u, --update        update the categories [requires no query]
    -U, --update-reference
                        update the reference category (takes quite some time)
                        [requires no query]
    -c, --classify      classify each message matching the given query (to
                        test the trained categories)

  Query modifiers:
    Please specify either --all or --new or a query string. The default
    query for the update actions is a random selection of
    REFERENCE_SET_SIZE mails from the last REFERENCE_SET_TIMEFRAME days.

    -a, --all           operate on all messages
    -n, --new           operate on all new messages

  General options:
    -C NOTMUCH_CONFIG, --notmuch-config=NOTMUCH_CONFIG
                        path to the notmuch configuration file [default:
                        $NOTMUCH_CONFIG or ~/.notmuch-config]
    -e ENABLE_FILTERS, --enable-filters=ENABLE_FILTERS
                        filter classes to use, separated by ',' [default: all]
    -d, --dry-run       don't change the db [default: False]
    -R REFERENCE_SET_SIZE, --reference-set-size=REFERENCE_SET_SIZE
                        size of the reference set [default: 1000]
    -T DAYS, --reference-set-timeframe=DAYS
                        do not use mails older than DAYS days [default: 30]
    -v, --verbose       be more verbose, can be given multiple times



Boring stuff
============

Adding --dry-run to any --tag action prevents modification of the
notmuch db. Add some -vv goodness to see some action.

Basic tagging stuff requires no configuration, just run

$ afew --tag --new

To do this automatically you can add the following hook into your
~/.offlineimaprc:

postsynchook = ionice -c 3 chrt --idle 0 /bin/sh -c "notmuch new && afew --tag --new"


The real deal
=============

Let's train on an existing tag 'spam':

$ afew --learn spam -- tag:spam

Let's build the reference category. This is important to reduce the
false positive rate. This may take a while...

$ afew --update-reference

And now let's create a new tag from an arbitrary query result:

$ afew -vv --learn sourceforge -- sourceforge

Let's see how good the classification is:

$ afew --classify -- tag:inbox and not tag:killed
Sergio López <slpml@sinrega.org> (2011-10-08) (bug-hurd inbox lists unread) --> no match
Patrick Totzke <reply+i-1840934-9a702d09342dca2b120126b26b008d0deea1731e@reply.github.com> (2011-10-08) (alot inbox lists) --> alot
[...]

As soon as you trained some categories, afew will automatically
tag your new mails using the classifier. If you want to disable this
feature, either use the --enable-filters option to override the default
set of filters or remove the files in your afew state dir:

$ ls ~/.local/share/afew/categories
alot juggling  reference_category  sourceforge  spam

You need to update the category files periodically. I'd suggest to run

$ afew --update

on a weekly and

$ afew --update-reference

on a monthly basis.



Have fun :)
